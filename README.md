## 🌟 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Automatically handles missing values and scales data.
- **Clustering**: Implements K-Means with customizable parameters.
- **Evaluation**: Uses silhouette scores to evaluate cluster quality.
- **Visualization**: Includes plots for distributions, correlations, and cluster results.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bautistao2/force2020-ml-competition.git
cd force2020-ml-competition
```

### 2️⃣ Set Up the Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

**On Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Add the Dataset
Place your dataset in the `data/` folder. Make sure the file name matches the path specified in `config.py`:

```python
DATA_PATH = "data/force2020_data_unsupervised_learning.csv"
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Example Script

Run the clustering pipeline:
```bash
python src/example.py
```

## 📊 Example Outputs

- **Silhouette Score**: Quantifies the quality of the clustering.
- **Cluster Visualizations**: Plots showing how data points are grouped into clusters.
- **CSV Output**: Dataset with assigned cluster labels saved to `data_with_clusters.csv`.
